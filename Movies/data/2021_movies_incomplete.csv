The film reveals art-making not as rehabilitation but a way to reconnect to a sense of purpose and pride, to protest disability stigma and social isolation, and to contribute to society.

After a wild night, a group of young wealthy friends wake up from their drunken stupor with a freakish disco- very : each of them has grown a pair of fangs – vampire teeth. Bewildered at first, the group realizes they feel stronger and more attractive than ever before. As they strain to make sense of their new situation, they lose themselves in a twisted game of taking their new vampire skills to the streets. In this new kind of nightlife, with the limits of life, love and death greatly blurred, it dawns on the group that they can no longer trust each other. Nobody can be sure of what this vampire business is all about - or, for that matter, if any of this is even real.",2.265,/ojmMDvb5rt9q9oKY0H3jS2UrdBx.jpg,2021-02-05,Dead & Beautiful,False,6.7,3

He started out making comedies and whodunits, including the classic giallo ""Don’t Torture a Duckling"" (1972), then turned to the horror genre in the late ‘70s, directing pictures like ""Zombie Flesh Eaters"" (1979) and the famous ""Gates of Hell"" trilogy (1981–82), which prompted French film critics to dub him the 'poet of the macabre' and the 'godfather of gore.' Today his films are deemed the cornerstones of the splatter genre, receiving tributes from directors like Sam Raimi and Quentin Tarantino.
